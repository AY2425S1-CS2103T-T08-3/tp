### About us

Welcome to the MedDict User Guide!

MedDict is a _desktop application designed for medical staff_ who manage a large number of patients. It simplifies data entry and retrieval, allowing quick access to contact details, patient conditions, and the progress of recurring or long-term patients. The application is designed with large databases in mind, supporting a streamlined process for tracking medical history, patient appointments, and treatment progress.

Unlike most other applications who predominantly function on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where most of the user's inputs and outputs are achieved via the use of a mouse or touchscreen, MedDict is built upon the philosophy that a Command Line Interface (CLI) -- where all features and utility can be achieved via typed-in commands -- would be far more efficient.

With MedDict, we believe we can revolutionise your work and management experience! ðŸ’ª

With all that said, let's get you started on your journey towards a new peak level of efficiency! ðŸ’¯

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the Data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the Data File

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving Data Files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: I am left-clicking to open the file but nothing happens / there is an error message!<br>
**A**: To open and run MedDict, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start)!

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: I want to update my version of MedDict with the newest version, how do I transfer my data? Is that possible?<br>
**A**: No worries, you can easily transfer your data! Refer to the steps below.
1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `.jar` file. (Similar to steps in the [Detailed Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-beginner-friendly-detailed))
2. In that folder, find a folder titled data (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MedDict\data`)
3. Inside the folder, there should be a file titled addressbook.json, copy or backup this file into a safe location. (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MedDict\data\addressbook.json`)
4. Download the new release or version of MedDict (you can refer to the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start) if needed)
5. Open / run the application once.
6. Close the application.
7. Go to where the new MedDict `.jar` file is located in, and repeat steps 2 to 3.
8. Replace the new addressbook.json file in the current data folder with the previous addressbook.json file that you have copied or saved. You can do this by copying the addressbook.json file from the old data folder and pasting it in the new data folder. When prompted to overwrite, click yes. Alternatively, you can use a text editor of your choice to edit the new and old addressbook.json file, then copy and paste all the content from the old addressbook.json file to the new one.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
